Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Virtual California is a boundary element code designed to investigate long
 term fault system behavior and interactions between faults through stress
 transfer.
 It is released under the MIT Public License (see Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:License"

\end_inset

).
 The core code is written in C++ and can be run on a variety of parallel
 processing computers, including shared and distributed memory platforms.
 To allow increased functionality including development of other simulators,
 analysis scripts, and visualization tools, some key components of Virtual
 California have been placed in the QuakeLib library which can be called
 from C/C++ programs or Python scripts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
About Virtual California
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Virtual California is a boundary element code that performs simulations
 of fault systems based on stress interactions between fault elements to
 understand long term statistical behavior.
 It performs these simulations using a model of faults embedded in a homogeneous
 elastic half space with arbitrary dips and rakes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The code performs calculation assuming linear stress increase in the long
 term based on element-element interaction calculations governed by Okada's
 implementation of Green's functions.
 During the rupture (earthquake) phase elements may fail and release stress
 based on a combination of static and dynamic stress thresholds.
 The behavior of the system is determined by interactions between elements
 from the Green's function and the stress release from elements during events.
 More detail about the equations and physics of the simulation is described
 in Section

\begin_layout Section
History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Virtual California (abbreviated VC) started as a limited simulation model
 for distributed seismicity on the San Andreas and adjacent faults in southern
 California, developed by Rundle 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rundle:1988bj"

\end_inset

 in Fortran.
 This model included stress accumulation, release and interactions between
 faults to investigate earthquake dynamics in southern California.
 The model was updated in the early to mid-2000s 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "2001PhRvL..87n8501R,Rundle2002gem,Rundle2006vc"

\end_inset

 to include major strike-slip faults in California and was named Virtual
 California.
 This model and simulation was used to examine recurrence time statistics
 on California faults by Yakovlev 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "2005AGUFMNG21A..03Y"

\end_inset

, where it was concluded that the return times on a fault is well approximated
 by a Weibull distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2010 Virtual California was rewritten by Eric Heien in C++ to have a
 more modular simulation framework and add support for multiprocessor simulation
 using OpenMP and/or MPI.
 The fault model in Virtual California was also more cleanly separated from
 the fundamental stress calculation to allow simulation of other fault systems,
 including the Nankai trough in Japan 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "2010PhDT"

\end_inset

.
 Additional features were also added, including a branching aftershock sequence
 (BASS) model simulation of aftershocks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "npg-18-955-2011"

\end_inset

, improved stress Green's function calculations, more sophisticated rupture
 propagation, and support of parallel HDF5 output.
 Virtual California was also used in an effort by the Southern California
 Earthquake Center to unify and compare the results from several earthquake
 simulators 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TullisNovember/December"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2011 and 2012, core components of Virtual California were separated into
 the QuakeLib library and used to create analysis and visualization tools.
 Improvements to simulation performance were also developed, including speculati
ve execution for rupture propagation and a Barnes-Hut style approximation
 scheme for the Green's functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
About QuakeLib
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
QuakeLib is a C++ library containing key mathematics, geophysics and I/O
 functionality related to earthquake simulation and result analysis.
 QuakeLib is currently distributed with and is used by Virtual California,
 though it can be compiled and installed by itself on a machine.
 More specifically, QuakeLib contains 1) functions to read, write and validate
 fault models and earthquake catalogs in the EqSim format, 2) C++ classes
 to represent and access these models and catalogs, 3) C++ classes to represent
 faults and associated fault parameters as well as functionality related
 to the faults, 4) C++ classes and functions to perform vector mathematics
 and unit/geographic conversions related to modeling, 5) functions to evaluate
 stress and displacement fields based on Okada's equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 given a rectangular fault or point source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
QuakeLib is also written to support extension to other scripting languages
 through the use of the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG)
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Beazley:1996:SEU:1267498.1267513"

\end_inset

.
 Currently this supports wrapping the QuakeLib library in a Python interface
 though additional scripting languages can be easily added.
 The scripting extension allows researchers to write analysis and visualization
 scripts based on the same equations and data formats as the simulation.
 The Python interface is also used as the basis for a testing framework
 to ensure that any changes made to the code do not affect the scientific
 results and that computations on different platforms yield the same results
 within a specified tolerance.

VC Components and Governing Equations

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three major components that make up Virtual California: a fault
 model, a set of quasi-static interactions (Green’s functions), and an event
 model.
 In spite of the name, the only component of Virtual California that is
 specific to California is the fault model.
 This model can be changed to any physically realistic model and still correctly
 work with the simulation physics and event model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Fault Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model that is currently in use is based on the EQSIM format developed
 by the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UCERF2"

\end_inset

.
 The model includes 181 fault sections roughly corresponding to known faults
 in California, with some faults modeled by multiple sections.
 Each fault section is meshed into square elements that are roughly 3 km
 × 3 km, for a total of 14,474 elements.
 In the present version of our model, the creeping section of the San Andreas
 fault is removed.
 This section produces many events, slowing the simu- lation down considerably.
 Each element in the model is given a constant back-slip velocity along
 a fixed rake vector and a failure stress.
 The rake vector always lies in the plane of the element; and, the angle
 of the vector relative to the surface of the Earth, along with the rate
 of slip, are quantities that are taken from the UCERF2 model.
 The failure stresses, which are also required for the model, are derived
 from paleoseismic event recurrence times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Model Parameters and Initial Conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Virtual California uses established scaling laws to determine certain model
 parameters and initial conditions.
 Past simulations required that the user specify the stress parameters on
 each element then run the simulation based on this.
 However, the parameters to produce realistic results depend strongly on
 the model fault geometry, size of fault elements and friction properties.
 Furthermore these parameters can be easily modified to produce arbitrary
 fault behavior.
 Rather than require the user to specify these parameters, they are internally
 calculated by VC to match established physical laws and empirical observations.

For each fault VC calculates the expected moment magnitude from an earthquake
 that ruptures all elements on the fault.
 This is based on the equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M=a+b*log(RA)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where RA is the total area of all elements on the fault, and 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 are based on empirical observation.
 By default 
\begin_inset Formula $a=4.07$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b=0.98$
\end_inset

.
 These values do not vary significantly for strike-slip vs.
 normal vs.
 reverse faults, and they are measured for a wide range of both fault lengths
 (from a 2-5000 kilometers) and earthquake magnitudes (4.8 to 7.9).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given this moment magnitude, VC determines the maximum slip on the elements
 that would generate such an event:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\Delta s=\frac{10^{(3/2)(M+10.7)}}{lame*RA}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

TODO: is this slip-moment relationship correct?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VC also calculates the lithostatic normal force acting on each element based
 on the depth using the equation:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{n}=\rho gd

\begin_layout Standard
VC treats a system of faults as multiple planar elements embedded in a flat
 homogeneous halfspace.
 To run Virtual California the first step is to define a fault system using
 a set of traces.
 Each trace describes the points along a given fault closest to the surface
 as well as fault characteristics at each trace point, such as long term
 velocity, dip angle, rake angle, depth, etc.
 Details about the trace file format are shown in Appendix

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this example we look at the earthquake cycle and rupture mechanics on
 a single 12 km square fault.
 For simplicity, the trace of this fault runs eastward for 12km starting
 from latitude/longitude (0,0) and ending at latitude/longitude .
 The definition of this fault is in the file examples/fault_traces/single_fault_

The first non-comment line in this file gives the fault ID, number of trace
 points, and fault name.
 In this example, the fault is named "One_Fault_Example".
 The remaining non-comment lines give the fault characteristics at each
 trace point.
 This file defines two trace points, the first at latitude/longitude (0,0)
 and the second at (0, 0.1078), with both at altitude 0.
 At each point the fault extends 12,000 meters down and has a slip rate
 of 1 cm/year with 0 aseismicity.
 The fault is right lateral strike slip (rake of 180°, dip of 90°).
 The Lamé parameters of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=3e10$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=3.2e10$
\end_inset

 indicate the material properties of the fault.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given this fault definition we can create a mesh which fits within the fault
 dimensions.
 Each fault is meshed by specifying the fault trace file in the format described
 above, and a fault element size.
 Currently all fault elements in Virtual California are square though future
 versions will allow triangulare elements.
 Furthermore, all elements of a single fault are meshed at the same resolution.
 This means that if the meshing resolution is not a perfect multiple of
 the trace length or depth at a given point, the meshed elements will not
 completely cover the trace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:trace_mesh_example"

\end_inset

 shows this for an example fault trace consisting of 4 trace points, where
 the fault trace is represented by a dashed line and the meshed elements
 represented by red segments.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:exact_trace_mesh"

\end_inset

 shows the meshed model on this fault with elements that match the lengths
 between the trace points.
 Because the distance between trace points is exactly a multiple of the
 element size, the meshed elements exactly cover the fault trace.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:offset_trace_mesh"

\end_inset

 shows the same fault trace with smaller meshed elements.
 The first element follows the trace but the second element deviates in
 order to fit the meshed element along the trace.
 In practice, this discrepancy is usually not a big issue because fault
 traces are not significantly non-linear.
 Also, as elements become smaller relative to the distance between trace
 points this discrepancy becomes smaller.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When creating a meshed element along a fault trace it is necessary to assign
 characteristics to the element such as slip rate, aseismic slip, rake,
 dip, and Lamé parameters.
 These are determined by linear interpolation of the fault trace values
 at the midpoint of the meshed element.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of linear interpolation for values between fault trace points also
 means that if the meshed elements are larger than the distance between
 fault trace points and there is significant variation between trace point
 characteristics, then this variation may be lost during the meshing process.
 In general it is recommended to use an element size smaller than the smallest
 distance between fault trace points unless there are memory or computing
 constraints.
 In the event that the meshing process skips a trace point because of overly
 large element size, a warning will be output.
 Appropriate element size is further discussed in Section

 When performing simulations with realistic fault systems it is better to
 use actual fault latitude/longitude in the traces to help visualize the
 simulation results.

Element Stress Interactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike actual fault systems where the fault geometry is dynamic over long
 time periods, Virtual California simplifies calculations assuming a geometrical
ly static fault system.
 In this way Virtual California is intended to explore seismicity in fault
 systems as they appear today rather than attempting to model their long
 term evolution.
 Back slip is used to model the effects of stress buildup and release along
 elements approximating the fault plane.
 In a back slip model, the equilibrium and initial positions of an element
 are the same, thus when an element fails it moves towards the original
 position and the fault system geometry remains static.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Green's Functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interactions between fault elements depend on the relative position and
 orientation of each element, and are calculated using stress Green's functions
 at the start of the simulation.

\begin_inset Formula $T_{ij}^{kl}(x-x')$
\end_inset

 is the Green's function tensor, and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 goes over all elements.
 In Virtual California this field is evaluated only at the center of elements
 and slip is assumed to be uniform across the surface of an element and
 along the element rake angle defined in the model.
 Under these conditions equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 simplifies to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{ij}^{A}(t)=\sum T_{ij}^{AB}s_{B}(t)\label{eq:simple_stress_field}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where B runs over all elements.
 Finally, since Virtual California only uses the shear stress along the
 element rake vector and normal stress perpendicular to the element, the
 tensor

\end_inset

 reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}$
\end_inset

 for shear stresses and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{n}$
\end_inset

 for normal stresses.
 This means the shear and normal stresses on an element in Virtual California
 are calculated as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{s}^{A}(t)=\sum T_{s}^{AB}s_{B}(t)\label{eq:shear_stress_sum}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, for a fault model with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 elements Virtual California requires two

 These are also referred to as the Green's function matrices.

Event Transition Time

\begin_layout Standard
Virtual California uses a combined static-dynamic friction law to calculate
 element failures.
 This law is based on the Coulomb failure function (CFF):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
CFF^{A}(t)=\sigma_{s}^{A}(t)-\mu_{s}^{A}\sigma_{n}^{A}(t)\label{eq:cff_function}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{s}^{A}$
\end_inset

 is the static coefficient of friction on element 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 based on model element strengths.
 During long term stress accumulation, an element is defined to fail at
 time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{f}$
\end_inset

 when 
\family roman

\noun off
\color none

\begin_inset Formula $CFF^{A}(t_{f})=0$
\end_inset

, which is referred to as static failure.
 At this point the simulation changes to the rupture event model described
 below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the change in stress over time it is relatively straightforward to
 calculate the time to failure for an element.
 Since effective long term slip rates during stress accumulation are assumed
 to be constant the change in CFF over time is governed by the equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{dCFF^{A}}{dt}=(\sigma_{s}^{A}-\mu_{s}^{A}\sigma_{n}^{A})+\alpha T_{\alpha}^{A}\label{eq:cff_change}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 represents the fraction of fault slip that is aseismic and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\alpha}^{A}=\frac{CFF^{A}T^{AA}}{rec}$
\end_inset

 represents the instanteous change in CFF due to aseismic slip.
 Aseismic slip on an element transmits stress to other elements but not
 on the element itself.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is 0, the equation simplifies to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
t_{f}=t_{0}+\frac{CFF^{A}}{(\sigma_{s}^{A}-\mu_{s}^{A}\sigma_{n}^{A})}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the starting time of long term stress accumulation in the system.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>0$
\end_inset

 then Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 can be solved analytically to yield:

 The factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{N_{ef}}{S_{t}}$

 captures the current size of the rupture with 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{ef}$
\end_inset

 representing the number of failed elements on the currently rupturing fault
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t}$
\end_inset

 representing the slip-scaling threshold parameter.
 This factor prevents small ruptures from excessively slipping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the slip is calculated for one or more elements, a new stress state
 for the entire system is calculated using Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:norm_stress_sum"

\end_inset

.
 Additional elements will fail if their CFF = 0 (static failure).
 To better model rupture propagation dynamic failure is also allowed during
 rupture events.
 Dynamic failure allows elements on the same fault and physically nearby
 to failed elements to themselves fail at a lower stress level than the
 static failure criterion.
 This dynamic failure is based on the increase in stress during the rupture
 event.
 An element experiences dynamic failure if it is on the same fault as an
 already failed element and satisfies:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{CFF_{init}-CFF_{final}}{CFF_{init}}>\eta\label{eq:dynamic_trigger}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is a user defined dynamic triggering parameter either for the whole system
 or uniquely defined for each element.
 This parameter approximates the stress intensity factor at the tip of a
 propagating rupture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During rupture propagation, elements that have not completely slipped back
 to equilibrium may fail again (potentially multiple times) and release
 more stress.
 However, elements may not slip away from equilibrium meaning they cannot
 absorb stress released by other failed elements.
 This reflects the fact that failed elements may not heal during a rupture
 but also may not release all accumulated stress immediately.
 It is also important to note that an element may not release all accumulated
 stress during a rupture, due to the slip-scaling threshold (Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:sst_one"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:sst_two"

\end_inset

) and dynamic triggering (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dynamic_trigger"

\end_inset

), as well as the stress state of all elements at the start of rupture.
 For example, if all elements are in a high stress state then a small initial
 rupture can quickly propagate and become a large stress release event,
 whereas if most elements are in a low stress state then a large initial
 rupture may quickly stop propagating and release relatively little stress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples of stress accumulation and release over multiple phases of long
 term stress accumulation and rupture events are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cff_example_history"

\end_inset

.
 The first figure shows how a single element failure leads to a rupture
 spanning multiple elements and how stress builds up and releases in cycles
 over time.
 The second figure shows how elements may fail multiple times during different
 sweeps in an event, but do not accumulate additional stress after failing.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:simulation_flow"

\end_inset

 shows the flow of simulation in Virtual California.
 The simulation begins by reading in a set of faults and converting them
 to the internal data structures.
 When running a parallel simulation, these are partitioned over multiple
 processes to ensure that each process is responsible for roughly an equal
 number of elements and that elements on the same processor are on the same
 fault or geographically close to each other.
 Next, each processor calculates the stress Green's functions on the local
 elements for all other elements in the model or loads precomputed Green's
 functions from a file.
 This comprises the initialization phase of the simulation shown in green
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:simulation_flow"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core of the simulation consists of repeated cycling between two phases
 until the end of the simulation time.
 The first phase, shown in blue, calculates the long term stress buildup
 and time to first element failure in the system based on Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:cff_function"

\end_inset

.
 In parallel simulations this time is calculated locally on each process
 then reduced to a global time to failure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second phase is the rupture propagation phase, shown in purple in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:simulation_flow"

\end_inset

.
 Virtual California uses a cellular automata style approach to modeling
 rupture propagation.
 The rupture phase does not involve time domain solutions to differential
 equations, but rather iterative calculations of stress and element failure
 to approximate a rupture propagating through the fault system.

If you have a third party installation of python (ie.
 from homebrew or macports) Virtual California will build and install, but
 the python quakelib module may not work.
 This is because cmake builds against the system python.
 To fix this do the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ ./configure
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cmake will output the following:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The size of the meshed elements will affect both simulation accuracy and
 computational resource requirements.
 The appropriate size of fault elements for a given simulation depends on
 the desired minimum earthquake magnitude and the available computational
 resources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Element Size and Minimum Magnitude
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between element size and minimum magnitude is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M_{min}=\frac{2}{3}log_{10}(1e7\mu sL^{2})-10.7
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is the Lamé parameter, s is the minimum slip distance, and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the element size in meters.
 The minimum slip distance, s, will depend on the orientation of the element,
 the total fault size, and the interaction with other elements in the system,
 but will generally range from approximately 0.1 to 1.0 meters.
 For example, for the 12km x 12km fault described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:define_mesh_faults"

\end_inset

 the minimum slip distance is 0.3 meters.
 Figure

 magnitude.

\begin_layout Subsection
Element Size and Required Memory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of elements in a model will also affect the required memory.
 Since VC uses a Barnes-Hut style approximation algorithm for fault interaction
 the actual memory required will depend on the accuracy of the approximation.
 For non-approximated fault interaction in a model with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 elements, the memory requirements are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Memory=16N^{2}bytes
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the degree of approximation possible with Barnes-Hut will vary depending
 on the system geometry it is not possible to give a function for memory
 requirements.
 For the UCERF model of all major faults in California (cite) we find the
 following equation gives a reasonable estimate of memory requirements for
 a given Barnes-Hut 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 parameter and number of elements 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

Parallel Performance

\begin_layout Standard
The program flow in Figure

 The global nature of these communications is a serious bottleneck to simulation
 performance on a parallel system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sim_breakdown"

\end_inset

 shows simulation run times for a 13,398 element 100,000 year simulation
 on a simple cluster system using different numbers of processors.
 The cluster has 16 nodes, with two 2.4 GHz quad-core Xeon processors per
 node and a Gigabit ethernet network.
 For a single processor, most of the time is spent in the long term stress
 calculation and the initial Green’s function calculations.
 As the number of processors increases these calculations scale well but
 the time spent in communi- cation significantly rises.
 By 16 processors the majority of simulation time is spent communicating
 and there is very poor strong scalability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sim_comm_breakdown"

\end_inset

 shows the breakdown in time for different types of communication.
 For all numbers of processors, the majority of time is spent distributing
 stress values over the processors.
 This is required because the changes in stress during a rupture potentially
 lead to other elements rupturing.
 However, at a given rupture propagation step it is highly unlikely the
 rupture will spread a significant distance past where it already has traveled.

\begin_layout Standard
These tutorials are meant to serve as a guide to some of the types of problems
 VC can solve.
 These cookbook examples are distributed with the package under the

 However, you might need to edit these example scripts slightly to launch
 the job on your cluster (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref

\end_inset

 for more information).
 Each tutorial is a self-contained lesson in how to use Virtual California.
 The tutorials increase in degree of complexity from one to the next.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prerequisites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you begin any of the tutorials, you will need to install Virtual
 California following the instructions in Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Input Files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fault model and a file named params.d must be in the same directory as
 the compiled application.
 An example params.d file can be found in example/sample_params.d.
 In order to run, the model files must be named in the QuakeLib file parameters
 section of the file.
 Only a friction and geometry file are necessary.
 See section

Trace File Format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The initial fault geometry for VC runs is defined by the trace file.
 Each trace file describes a single fault by the location of points along
 the fault trace and associated fault characteristics at each of the points.
 A single VC model for a simulation can be generated by combining multiple
 fault traces using the vc_edit program (see Cookbook XXX for an example).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trace files are ASCII format with comments indicated by a # (hash) mark.
 Lines that begin with a # will be ignored and any values after a # in a
 line will be ignored.
 The initial line in the trace file outlines the fault described in the
 file using the following attributes:

Virtual California Output File Format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The format of the output files of Virtual California is described here.
 All outputs are in non-dimensional units unless specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
HDF5 Output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Virtual California is compiled with the HDF5 library it is possible to
 output simulation results in this format.
 This format aims to be a full description of the simulation and results,
 containing both a description of the fault system and events that occurred
 on the system.
 In this way the user can write scripts that can read all information from
 a single source.
 The output file is composed of several tables and datasets describing the
 input and output to a simulation.
 Depending on user options some of these tables may be empty but they will
 always exist in the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Datasets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The HDF5 output file contains two datasets describing some simulation parameters.
 The first dataset is named 
\family typewriter
\size small
base_lat_lon
\family default
\size default
 and describes the latitude and longitude point used as the reference for
 converting input element locations to a Cartesian grid system for simulation.
 The second dataset is named 
\family typewriter
\size small
sim_years
\family default
\size default
 and describes the beginning and ending simulation year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Element Table
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table titled 
\family typewriter
\size small
block_info_table
\family default
\size default
 describes the set of all elements used in the simulation.
 The information for each element is a row in the table, with each column
 representing an attribute of the block.
 The attributes are defined as follows:

HDF5 Files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
About HDF5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) is a portable file format developed at
 the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It is designed for storing, retrieving, analyzing, visualizing, and converting
 scientific data.
 The current and most popular version is HDF5, which stores multi-dimensional
 arrays together with ancillary data in a portable self-describing format.
 It uses a hierarchical structure that provides application programmers
 with a host of options for organizing how data is stored in HDF5 files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HDF5 files are organized in a hierarchical structure, similar to a Unix
 file system.
 Two types of primary objects, 
\shape italic
groups
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
datasets
\shape default
, are stored in this structure.
 A group contains instances of zero or more groups or datasets, while a
 dataset stores a multi-dimensional array of data elements.
 Both kinds of objects are accompanied by supporting metadata.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A dataset is physically stored in two parts: a header and a data array.
 The header contains miscellaneous metadata describing the dataset as well
 as information that is needed to interpret the array portion of the dataset.
 Essentially, it includes the name, datatype, dataspace, and storage layout
 of the dataset.
 The name is a text string identifying the dataset.
 The datatype describes the type of the data array elements.
 The dataspace defines the dimensionality of the dataset, i.e., the size and
 shape of the multi-dimensional array.
 The dimensions of a dataset can be either fixed or unlimited (extensible).
 The storage layout specifies how the data arrays are arranged in the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data array contains the values of the array elements and can be either
 stored together in a contiguous file space or split into smaller 
\shape italic
chunks
\shape default
 stored at any allocated location.
 Chunks are defined as equally-sized multi-dimensional subarrays (blocks)
 of the whole data array and each chunk is stored in a separate contiguous
 file space.
 Extensible datasets whose dimensions can grow are required to be stored
 in chunks.
 One dimension is increased by allocating new chunks at the end of the file
 to cover the extension.

\begin_layout Standard
HDF5 also supports access to portions (or selections) of a dataset by 
\shape italic
hyperslabs
\shape default
, which consist of a subarray or strided subarray of the multi-dimensional
 dataset.
 The selection is performed in the file dataspace for the dataset.
 HDF5 also supports parallel I/O.
 Parallel access is supported through MPI-IO.
 The file and datasets are collectively created/opened by all participating
 processes.
 Each process accesses part of a dataset by defining its own file dataspace
 for that dataset.
 When accessing data, the data transfer property specifies whether each
 process will perform independent I/O or all processes will perform collective
 I/O.

Accessing Data Using HDFView
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NCSA HDFView is a visual tool for accessing HDF files.
 You can use it for viewing the internal file hierarchy in a tree structure,
 creating new files, adding or deleting groups and datasets, and modifying
 existing datasets.
 HDFView is capable of displaying 2D slices of multi-dimensional datasets,
 with navigation arrow buttons that enable you to range over the entire
 extent of a third dimension.
