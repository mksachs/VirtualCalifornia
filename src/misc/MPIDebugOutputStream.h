/*
 MPI Debug Output Class
 Problem: Using normal cerr or cout on MPI causes output to mix, you don't know which machine wrote the output, it's hard to merge output from different systems
 Solution: Provide a unified interface to output on an MPI system
 What we need:
 Should act like a standard stream, during initialization user specifies a standard stream it will output to
 Should provide options to clarify output (node rank, node name?, time stamps, etc)
 Should provide debug levels to ignore output for non-debug runs
 Should provide gathering function to collect values over multiple nodes and output in a specified order
